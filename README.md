Things Jason is doing with Nix 
* nix-uninstall.sh - uninstall Nix from MacOS.  Tested on MacOS 12.3.1 (Monterey).  Should work on MacOS11 (Big Sur), but I haven't tried.  It's very rough so use at your own risk.  No warranty expressed, implied, or even mildly suggested. Best I can tell you is it worked for me after I installed Monterey from scratch and used migration assistant to pull everything from a time-machine backup.  Nix was badly borked and this script fixed it.
